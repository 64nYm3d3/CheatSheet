# OSSTMM
### Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual

While there are many different security testing methodologies, ISECOM's OSSTMM is one that stands out, partially because its a mouthful to say, and its free. Methodology for testing and engagement can vary based on requirements, and while there are few different methods people follow based on preferences, I like this one quite a bit.
