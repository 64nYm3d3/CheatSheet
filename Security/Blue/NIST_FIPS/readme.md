Federal Information Processing Standards

FIPS publications are intended for use by federal government agencies to protect non-national security federal information 
systems. FIPS publications do not apply to national security systems (as defined in Title III,
Information Security, of FISMA). FIPS publications may be adopted and used by non-federal government organizations
and private sector organizations.
