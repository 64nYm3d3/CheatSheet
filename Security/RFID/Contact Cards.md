Chip Adhesive: Pretty sure this is self explanatory, adhesive keeping the chip in place inside the encapsulation

Hotmelt: I'm guessing this is glue mounting the substrate to the card body

Substrate: I'm guessing the is the mount for the contacts on the chip

Card Body: The pvc card the chip is attached to

Encapsulation: I'm guessing this is a supporting case that prevents physical damage and corrosion of the chip, and is probably IC packaging

Chip: It kind of looks like a semi conductor device honestly Im not sure what the purpose of this is in detail 

Wire Bonding: A way of making interconnections between an IC or other semi conductor device and IC packaging

ISO 7816 (Which I didnt use because of the common 200$ shakedown and paywall, its a good thing they let us know "Only informative sections are publicly available" with this doc. The only public information from this ISO standard is the introduction and the definition of a few terms, so informative /s.)
