 **Underdoor_Tool**
<a name="Underdoor_Tool"></a>

A definite in every Red Teamer's toolbag. We've opened so many doors with this awesome tool!

## Lockpicks
<a name="Lockpicks"></a>

More lock picks than you need. We use 4 or 5 on a consistent basis for the past 8 years. But this will get you everything you need.

<a name="Go_Pro"></a>

Go Pro Hero 6 Black
We use our GoPro with the head and chest mount pretty heavily during recon and execution. It's awesome for capturing evidence! However, it's not good in low light situations, even with version 6. It's small enough to cup in your hand, which we do often!


**Nikon_P900**
<a name="Nikon_P900"></a>

Nikon COOLPIX P900 Digital Camera with 83x Optical Zoom and Built-In Wi-Fi(Black) 
This is awesome for long-distance recon under low light conditions. This has exceptional zoom and takes crisp photos.

## Binoculars 
<a name="Binoculars"></a>

Pretty good binos for long-distance recon or for monitoring the Red Team from afar.

## Wearable

**Headlamp**
<a name="Headlamp"></a>

A great headlamp that we use on our Red Team Operations. It can switch to red, which is most advantageous when in covert situations. Check your light discipline!
