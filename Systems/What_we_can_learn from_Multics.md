# The history and Importance of Multics
This researach project was a suggestion by Tony, who's place of work, identity, is a mystery, what I can tell you is that his demeanor, look, and prosody reminds me of Michael from vsauce. It came up because I was asking about different rings within an operating system. Where windows operating systems ran privileges in Ring 0 (Kernel) or Ring 3 (Application) there was a lesser used section (Rings 1 & 2) for drivers. I was asking about the purpose of them and Tony, being the only person in the room who knew what they are, told me to learn about the history of multics.

(Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) was a mainframe timesharing operating system begun in 1965 and used until 2000. Multics began as a research project and was an important influence on operating system development.

CTSS was the predecessor to Multics. It ran on a modified IBM 7094, with 32K of memory for the supervisor,0.35 MIPS (this is back before we had things like clock rate, this is the era of baud or in this case MIPS is Millions of Instructions Per second), and ogramsit could run simple channel programs, which is a sequence of channel command words (CCWs) which are executed by the I/O channel subsystem proprietary to the IBM System/360 and subsequent architecture
