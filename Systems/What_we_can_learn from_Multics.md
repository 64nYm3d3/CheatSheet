# The history and Importance of Multics
This researach project was a suggestion by Tony, who's place of work, identity, is a mystery, what I can tell you is that his demeanor, look, and prosody reminds sme of Michael from vsauce. It came up because I was asking about different rings within an operating system. Where windows operating systems ran privileges in Ring 0 (Kernel) or Ring 3 (Application) there was a lesser used section (Rings 1 & 2) for drivers. I was asking about the purpose of them and likely this is what we will learn
