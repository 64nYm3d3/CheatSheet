# Burp

Burp does stuff and things with web apps, it acts as a proxy between for your web browser allowing you to modify traffic and things.

When you intercept a thing like a get request, try changing the IP address to a domain name because of virtual host routing. You might find yourself being redirected to a different place!

Using the repeater you can modify and resend requests, for example, when uploading an image, you can change the content type field of the file, as well as add magic bytes to indicate it is an image when in fact it might be a php command fuzzing for remotw code injection.
