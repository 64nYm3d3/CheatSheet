Social engineering is great, actually absolutely fantastic and while its labeled as social engineering, I will try to include much more into this. I don't know whether to actually share some of these out of fear people will use these techniques to either stalk, harass, and even avoid them, but for all the bad possibilities, there is the chance that some good people out there use these to find and report the bad guys. Topics to cover:

SE, a guide to seduction via emotional triggers... and more

Congruence and being a gray man

Target specific messages (Spear Phishing)

Wardialing , Reconaiscance, Enumeration via non digital/mixed techniques and more

DOXing, OSINT, HUMINT, INT in general
