# Important Things

If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,

And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort, 

And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, 

Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!

---


If the label on the cable on the table at your house, 

Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, 

But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol, 

That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall, 

And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss

So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,

Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang,

'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!
