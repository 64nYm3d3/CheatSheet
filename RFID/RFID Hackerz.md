NFC is a protocol and passive. When an electromagnetic field is close enough to it, the spool kind of charges up and transfers data

125kHz is a prox card, and for 10 whole dollars can be copied with this thing

RFID tags by 2013 had spread like wildfire. All these tags being used by tech companies, hospitals, gyms usually ran a protocol 
called [em4100](http://www.priority1design.com.au/em4100_protocol.html) a 125kHz type of card with a (CMOS)[https://www.elprocus.com/cmos-working-principle-and-applications/] integrated circuit based card, where the information about the tag and fob were stored. Since these had no encryption they would broadcast to any nearby reader. There are some details that you can go into but for simplicity's sake these early cards had basically no security, purchase this https://www.ebay.com/bhp/rfid-copier and have fun.

13.6Mhz cards have a higher bandwitch and can do some neat stuff. It can support encryption and store more data. NFC is a protocol that I think can only run on these higher powered cards unfortunately I couldnt verify that and the ISO standardization documents suck  because the information I needed to learn the technical information about these technologies. "Only informative sections of standards are publicly available." behind a paywall, biggest lie on their website.
