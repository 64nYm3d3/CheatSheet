Print and Comments
~~~
#The use of an octothorpe (salt on those ampersands) lets you comment out a single line
'''
But if you need more space you can use 3 apostrophes before and after the message you want to say or quotation marks, really whatever you feel appropriate but if it extends beyond two lines like this comment it is useful
'''
print "Text that gets displayed"
print "This text is on a new line!"
print "If something comes out with funky looking stuff like this \" \' \" it needs an escape character"
print "Can do variable substitution to like this %s and the contents of the variable \" i \" will be displayed here" % i
print "You can append a number onto a print statement like this", i + 32 ," and the variable plus 32 will be displayed"
