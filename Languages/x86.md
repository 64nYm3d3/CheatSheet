# This is Advanced Darkness
Here is a secret that hits my greatest fear, the shellcoder cometh.

opcode fall under such a strange category for me, you code in C and then convert it to x86. You use small registers trying to avoi bad chars but it might be easier to just use msfencode, then again with that you're borrowing someone elses code for these environments. Maybe you need the same thing but with less space, lets say you need a reverse shell and know you can run it with less space in the same system than msfencode reverse shell, what do you do?

A modern computer makes no real distinction between instructions and data. If a processor can be fed instructions when it should be seeing data, it will happily go about executing the passed instructions. This characteristic makes system exploitation possible.
