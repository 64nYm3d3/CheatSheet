# Powershell for data exfil!

Powershell functions as a great tool for windows machines. Both PS and .net primitives are installed on every windows machine, and while you can use VBS or wscript to perform exfil, they come with a higher chance for detection. Powershell is a solid framework to perform in and we'll cover some usage and options here.

While there are multiple ways to exfiltrate data there are a a few common methods.

- Raw sockets
- HTTP/HTTPS
- Mail(SMTP)
- Other protocols(VoIP, QUIC, e.g.)
